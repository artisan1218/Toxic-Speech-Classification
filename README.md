# Toxic-Speech-Classification

This project introduced a method to classify
English toxic comments using state of
art transformers. We fine tuned the BERT
model and evaluated it using Kaggleâ€™s
toxic comment classification dataset and
twitter insult comment dataset. Also, we
use pseudo labeling technique on testing
data to enlarge our training dataset, which
boosted the performance of our model. We
achieved a very good performance with
accuracy 98.9% for binary classification
(toxic vs. non-toxic). Moreover, by combining
this classifier with a speech recognition
system, we created a high quality
toxic speech classifier which may be used
practically to detect toxic talk or conversation.
